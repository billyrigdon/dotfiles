[2020-08-19T11:11:37+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] 	Color printers need color profile files to get better results. These
[2020-08-19T11:11:37+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install them
[2020-08-19T11:11:37+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] manually. To do that, download the official linux drivers and locate the "cms"
[2020-08-19T11:11:37+0000] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] directory. Install the contents to "/usr/share/cups/profiles/$MANUFACTURER".
